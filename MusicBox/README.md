MusicBox 

Let¡¯s first understand the basic system components:
??CD player
??CD
??Display () (displays length of song, remaining time and playlist)
Now, let¡¯s break this down further:
??Playlist creation (includes add, delete, shuffle etc sub functionalities)
??CD selector
??Track selector
??Queueing up a song
??Get next song from playlist
A user also can be introduced:
??Adding
??Deleting
??Credit information
How do we group this functionality based on Objects (data + functions which go together)?
Object oriented design suggests wrapping up data with their operating functions in a single entity class.
